# What is Theology?

*Please note that this was written to be spoken with a slideshow, not read as plain text. It is not yet fully adapted for article format - though I hope to adapt it soon.*

## 1. Introduction

Good evening everyone. Well done for making it to Friday - and an even bigger well done for coming out on a Friday night. It's good to see everyone and to be here with you for the first session of Theology on Tap. 

So - for those of you who don't know, my name is Ben. I have been part of this church for about 6 or so years now, so you might have seen me around the place. I am married to the wonderful Rebecca, and we have two amazing boys together. For most of my adult life I have been a student of theology, which is one of my great passions. That doesn't mean I'm an expert - but it does mean I love it. I am currently exploring ordained ministry (and seeing where God leads me with that), and it's a real joy to see us gathered today to think together about theology and about God.

I just wanted to check - did you guys get one of these discussion prompt cards? Great. Hopefully that's provided some good food for thought and got you into the right mindset for some of what we're going to be thinking about today.

So today we're going to be kicking off Theology on Tap by thinking about the question, 'What is Theology?'. This session is intended to be introductory - to get the juices flowing - and to introduce us to the nature of Theology and what it's really about.

So before we get stuck in, I want to start with a small thought experiment if that's okay.

## 2. Theology as 'Why'

### 2.1. Thought Experiment

First, I want you to imagine yourself sitting on a park bench on a nice summer's day. Maybe you're reading a book or you're on your phone - or maybe you're just admiring the scenery. On the bench directly opposite to you are two individuals. On the left side of the bench is a man wearing a 3-piece suit, accompanied by his briefcase. On the right side of the bench is a young boy, slightly slouched, and listening to some music.

Suddenly, you feel an almighty slam on the back of your head. Your glasses - let's assume you're wearing glasses - fly off your face and onto the floor. For half a minute or so your vision is obstructed and blurry as you feel around for your glasses. Once you find them, you look up to see both people on the bench glaring at you. Looking around, you can't see anyone or anything nearby. Naturally, you ask the man and the boy on the bench: 'What happened?'.

The suited man is first to speak, and offers you this explanation: 'Well, there was a spherical object - a ball - weighing half a kilogram. It was moved by an external force and reached a speed of approximately 25 meters per second until your head brought it to a sudden stop'. You thank the man for his answer, turn to the boy, and ask him what happened. He responds: 'That guy over there kicked a ball at your head. Find him to find out what happened.'. You turn to look in the direction the boy is pointing, and - sure enough - you spot another individual walking away, ball in hand, and looking back at you.

So - I'd like a quick show of hands. Please raise your hand if you would find the answer of the man in the suit more helpful. ... Now please raise your hand if you would find the answer of the boy more helpful. ... Okay - interesting. So I think many of us would agree that the boy's answer hits home for us a bit more. It's more of a satisfactory answer, right? But the question is... why? Why do we prefer that answer to the question of what happened? 

Well - I want to spend one or two minutes thinking about this, because I think it helps us to understand something fundamental about theology, and we will see why in a little bit.

---

### 2.2. 'How' vs 'Why'

So - we want to know the answer to the question, 'What happened?'. Let's take our two answers and examine them. We have the answer of the man in the three-piece suit, and we have the answer of the young boy. What are their differences?

First of all, the man's answer is focusing on the various parts of the process which make up the event: the force which moves the ball, the ball itself, and, of course, your head. This paints a picture of the event for us, but it doesn't lead us to the origin of the event. We know nothing about what is behind the force that moved the ball in the first place. So, the man's answer doesn't tell us *why* the ball hit your head - instead it tells us *how*: there was a force, there was a ball, there was a head, and something happened between them.

The boy's answer, on the other hand - instead of focusing on the parts of the process - focuses on the origin: guy who kicked the ball. He is the main reason that the ball hit your head. In other words, the boy's answer tells us *why* the ball hit your head.

Because of this main difference, I like to name these kinds of answers 'how answers' and 'why answers'. All other differences between these types of answers stem from this distinction.

So - because 'how answers' focus on the parts of the process which make up the event, they tend to be *mechanical*. 'Why answers', however, tend to be *personal* for the simple reason that *footballs don't kick themselves; people kick them*. The origin behind an event needs to be something which has the power to start it: not an object (like a ball, or a foot), but something with the power to move objects (like a person).

Lastly, because 'why answers' tend to focus on people and their decisions, they often look like stories. 'How answers', however, are mostly descriptive of the objects and forces at play.

All-in-all, when we need to make sense of an event or a series of events, these are the two types of answers on offer. We have 'how answers', and 'why answers'. Neither is 'the correct one', so to speak, but they are doing quite different things. A 'how answer' focuses on describing the mechanism of an event; on explaining *how* it happened. A 'why answer', however, focuses on the often personal story behind it which tells us *why* it happened - regardless of how it happened. This, I think, is why we preferred the boy's answer: he gave us a personal and story-driven answer which got to the heart of *why* the ball did what it did.

### 2.3. The Guy and His Story

So, what does all of this have to do with theology? Well, I'd like to offer you one last illustration to bring us right into the depths of theology and what it's all about. Are you guys with me so far? Great.

These are our two boys: Jesse and Asa. I had the great privilege of Watching them both come into the world. It was a wonderful experience (wonderful apart from the labour, I might add - just thought I'd slip that in, or I'll be sleeping on the floor tonight ... love you darling). But during both births, I found myself wondering: 'What's it like for them?'; 'For the babies?'.

The more I thought about it, the more I realised: they must be absolutely terrified. *We* know everything is fine, but for them the entire world is being torn to shreds. One moment they're warm, cosy, weightless, and safe. In the next moment, there's nothing but intense sensory overload: bright lights, incessant noise, the blunt cold air, and the strain of their own body weight pulling and tugging on their limbs and their massive heads. No wonder they scream with all their might. These poor babies, at birth, get slammed in the back of the head by the ball of existence.

I am fairly confident that if we could translate those screams into English, we'd get something like, 'What is happening?'. As we grow, reeling from the shock, we eventually find our glasses on the floor; we learn how to handle the light, the cold, and the noise. We learn to walk and talk and express our emotions in a controlled manner. But despite this, I don't think that those first screams that we come into the world with ever really leave us. They just evolve.

One day, my boys will again ask the question, 'What is happening? Why am I here? What is all of this about?'. They might not ask me. They'll ask themselves. Perhaps they'll ask a friend, or a teacher. And there'll be no shortage of answers for them.

One answer they might get comes from the realm of Biology. 'Biology' is a Greek word. Rather, I should say that it is two Greek words stuck together. The end of the word - '-logy' is from the Greek word 'logia', which is the same word we get our word 'logic' from. Here, it means, 'the study of'; 'the study of' something. 'Bio' comes from the Greek word 'Bios' which means 'life'. So 'Biology' refers to the study of life. If my boys - if we - want to understand, generally, what is happening with life, this seems like a good starting point, right?

So, let's imagine my sons ask, 'What is happening with life and everything? What is going on?'. Biology might tell them something like this: 'Life began with a single cell. Over many ages it split and developed into fish. Over many more ages of natural selection, the primate, and then the Homo sapien, emerged, leading to... you.'

Looking at this, what I want us to ask is: Is this a 'how answer' or a 'why answer'? And I think that what we have here is a 'how answer'. This answer paints a picture of the development of life and *how* it might have emerged, but it doesn't tell us *why* the ball was moved; *why* life came to be.

Perhaps my boys will find some solace in another '-logy' word: Cosmology. 'Cosmo' comes from the Greek word 'Cosmos' meaning 'the universe'. And so, 'Cosmology' refers to the study of the universe. Again, this seems like a good place to find answers.

So, my sons come along and ask, 'What is happening with life and everything? What is going on?'. Cosmology might tell them something like this: 'Everything that exists was once squashed into one point until it exploded in a big bang. Atoms clumped together to form stars, planets, water, and finally the cells which developed into... you'. 

Again, I want us to ask: Is this 'how answer' or a 'why answer'? And again, I think that we have we have here is another 'how answer'. It paints a fascinating picture of universal history and *how* it may have unravelled, but it doesn't tell us *why* the ball was moved; *why* there was a big explosion of energy in the first place.

Now - let's say my sons turn to another '-logy' word. This time: Theology. 'Theo' comes from the Greek word 'Theo', which means 'God'. And so, 'Theology' refers to the study of God. The study of a guy. Interesting. This seems like an odd place to go. Surely the answer to what is happening with life and everything has nothing to do with some guy, right?

In any case, my sons ask again, 'What is happening with life and everything? What is going on?'. Theology comes along and says: 'That guy kicked it all off. Find him to find out what happened.'. 'How do we do that?', they ask. 'Well', Theology says, 'they wrote down a lot about him in these ancient books. That's a good place to start.'. So, my sons find these ancient books, turn to page 1, and read: 'In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, the light, the water, the land, the trees, the creatures, and, eventually... you'.

So, what kind of answer do we have here? Well, let's consider our answer types once again:

Our scientific answers: they're offering up an account of the processes which may have been a part of the events which formed our world and ultimately formed us. They paint a picture of *how* certain things came to be - but the *why* is still up for grabs. What 'kicked the ball' - so to speak - when it comes to the big bang, for example?

Theological answers, on the other hand, aren't offering up accounts of the various mechanisms which led to life and the universe. What they are offering up is an explanation as to *why*. They're saying, 'There's this guy, and he kicked it all off. So if you have any questions, study him and his story'.

Theologians have frequently spoken about theology this way.

I have slightly squashed these quotes to fit them on the slide - but the wording and essence remains the same.

Von Balthasar writes that, 'Theology is reflection upon God's action in history and the drama [the story] of his dealings with man'.

For Lesslie Newbigin, 'Theology is reflection within the story which scripture tells of the might acts of God'.

And N.T. Wright says that, 'Theology is the task of saying clearly and truly what the story of the world is; it is what happens when people reflect on God'.

So, Theology is study of the guy; the guy who kicked everything off, and his story.

If you have questions about the origins of everything - study the guy and his story. If you want to understand what and who you are - study the guy and his story. If you want to understand why things feel so broken, whether there is hope, and what to do next - study the guy and his story.

Of course, the guy is God, and his story is the story of the Bible - the biblical story. So what I'd like us to do - if it's alright - is some theology. I want to look at the guy and his story. You guys with me?

## 3. The Biblical Story

### 3.1. The Exodus Template

So - Theology; God and His story; the story of the Bible. How do we begin to engage with it? Well, in order to understand what is in our Bibles, I want to dive into what many theologians consider to be a backbone of the biblical narrative: The Exodus Story.

The Exodus story has five 'movements' to it:

1. First, the Israelites are in SLAVERY
2. Then God saves them from slavery in an act of REDEMPTION
3. He then makes a contract - or COVENANT - with them at Sinai
4. After which Israel wander for 40 years in the WILDERNESS
5. Before being led into the promised LAND

Now I realise I have skimmed over the story there - but we'll come back to it in a moment. What I want to focus on is this skeletal structure of the story: slavery, redemption, covenant, wilderness, and land.

Interestingly, these five steps make up a story template which seems to be used all over the Bible. In particular - there are three major biblical stories which use this template. Each of them are central to the biblical story, and this Exodus structure runs like a series of threads through each of them in a way that really helps us grasp the whole biblical narrative.

So what I want to do, if it's alright, is follow the three stories and track this Exodus structure through each of them. Hopefully, at the end, we'll have a good idea of what God's story is about. Does that sound good to you guys?

---

### 3.2. The Creation Story

So - let's get stuck in. The first story which uses this template - and this might surprise you - is the story of creation in Genesis 1-2. Let's have a look at it.

We know how it starts: In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. Genesis tells us that the world is formless, empty, dark, and watery.

But then, God creates the light, and in v6 it tells us that God 'separates the waters from the waters'. ... Isn't that interesting? Water on one side, and water on another side. Does that make you think of anything? Hm. Anyway, after this God creates land and the vegetation. Genesis 1:12 says: 'The land produced vegetation'. The Hebrew word for 'produced' here is [vattotse], which is the word for 'Exodus'. So, the vegetation is 'exodus-ed' form the land. Again, interesting.

So, already in the creation story, we have a water-splitting event - which is reminiscent, of course, of the red sea crossing - and we have reference to an 'exodus'. Given this, you might be asking, 'Is this more than just coincidence?'. Well, many scholars think yes. There are a whole bunch of other clues just like these that have led many of them to the conclusion that the person writing about the creation has the Exodus on their mind. They seem to be writing about creation as a sort of Exodus story. In fact, you could say that they are using the Exodus template. So let's map it out:

SLAVERY & REDEMPTION. The writer appears to frame creation - at least of the vegetation - as a kind of 'Exodus'; a kind of deliverance. The vegetation is 'exodus-ed' after the waters are split in two. But that begs the question: what is creation being delivered from? Well, remember: just before creation the world was a watery, formless, empty, and dark place. And so, many have suggested that this is what God was redeeming and delivering creation from: the void; nothingness. Once, the world was enslaved to the void. But, by God's grace, it was rescued, and came into being. The oppressor - the void - is overcome.

COVENANT. So what happens after this? Well, God creates a human, and he makes an agreement with him; a sort of covenant. First God asks the human to look after the creation He has made, and then there is the command not to eat the fruit from the tree. So the agreement is about the human relationship with God and the human relationship with the world; obey and follow God on the one hand, and look after the world on the other.

(LAND). What do we see next? Well, God tells humanity that failure to keep the agreement - failure to obey God - results in death. The implication is that if they keep the agreement, they will remain living side-by-side with God in the good garden which He has made.

WILDERNESS. There is a brief period of waiting while God finishes His work of creation...

LAND. ...but the complete picture Genesis paints is the picture of a garden - a land - where God and humans walk, live, and partner together.

CONT. However, something unexpected happens to disrupt this good world. The humans, instead of obeying God, as they agreed, take advice from another creature - the snake - and as a result, they are banished from the good land. After this, Genesis shows us that when human relationship with God is disrupted by something - or someone - the task of looking after the world is also disrupted. And so Cain kills Abel, Babylon rises and the world is enslaved to evil, sickness, and ultimately death.

So what does this mean for our creation story? Well, tragically, it reverts back to the first step where creation is enslaved to the void; to death. And what's really interesting is that instead of just telling us this, Genesis shows us: In God's act of judgement, the waters which He had separated to free the world return to cover it in the story of Noah's flood. It is an act of un-creation; a return to slavery where death and the void now has a claim on everything.

---

### 3.3. The Exodus Story

So, that's the first story in the bible which uses the Exodus template - and it just so happens to be the opening and foundational narrative.

The second story I want us to look at which uses the Exodus template is, funnily enough, the Exodus story itself, which is of course the source of the Exodus template. So, the Exodus story comes not long after the tragic story of creation and its re-enslavement:

SLAVERY. God meets with this guy called Abraham and tells him that He is going to bless the *whole world* through his offspring. This is interesting because it looks like a subtle hint that God has a rescue plan in mind for creation involving Abraham's offspring. So we follow the story, and we find Abraham's offspring as *slaves* in Egypt.

REDEMPTION. God raises up Moses to deliver them, and He sends a plague of death to Egypt - but Israel are protected by the blood of a lamb on their houses. They are chased out of Egypt, but God opens the sea, and they escape. So, their oppressor is overcome.

COVENANT. God makes an agreement with Israel. He meets them in the form of cloud and fire. He tells them to follow Him - and nothing else - and to be an example to the nations. Perhaps this time, humans will follow God, and creation's life will be restored.

(LAND). If they keep the agreement, God promises to lead them to a good land where He will live and partner with them.

WILDERNESS. After 40 years of wandering and wrestling with God,

LAND. He leads them into this good land.

Sadly, once again, the story does not end well. Israel follows other gods, and they are a poor example. So, they are banished - exiled - from their land, and they are subjugated like slaves in the hands of the Babylonians. The great Exodus story itself, like the creation story, tragically reverts to its starting point. The world is still enslaved to death and the void.

---

### 3.4. The Jesus Story

So this story of the Exodus - the second story in the Bible which 'uses' the Exodus template - shows us the attempt to free the world from the slavery it was in. Shall we say that God failed? Well, the prophets still had hope. Isaiah wrote to the exiles in Babylon and said:

'This is what the Lord says – he who made a way through the sea, a path through the mighty waters, ... "Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past. See, I am doing a new thing! ... I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland."'

God, Isaiah says, is ready for a new Exodus.

You guys still with me? Awesome.

So, a few hundred years pass by, and a young girl gets a visit from an angel telling her that she will have a child. She is to name him Yeshua - Jesus: God saves.

SLAVERY. Jesus arrives on the scene of an enslaved world - enslaved to death and sickness. He walks around telling people about some so called good news. He heals the sick. He commands the sea. He raises the dead, famously saying to Lazarus: 'Come Out!'. In Greek: 'Deuro Exo!'.

REDEMPTION. At passover - the week commemorating the Exodus - he visits Jerusalem where he is arrested and killed. Three days later, he rises from the dead. Hm. But I thought the world was enslaved to death? Not anymore, Jesus says. He claims to have overthrown it, saying that he has all authority. He says that he - not death - is Lord. So, the oppressor is overcome.

COVENANT. Jesus' followers meet God's Spirit in the form of wind and fire; the Spirit Jesus said would remind them of his teaching: his commands to love God, and to love neighbour.

(LAND). Those who follow and belong to God, Jesus says, will inherit a new kingdom; a new world; a new land - where God and humanity will live and partner together.

WILDERNESS. So Jesus' followers - the Church - begin their journey. Like Israel in the wilderness, they celebrate freedom from the oppressor...

LAND. ...and eagerly await the promised land.

And with that final story - the story of Jesus - the Bible's story reaches a climax. We have a grand narrative of a good world intended to be jointly run by God and humans. It goes tragically wrong, and the world is enslaved to death - until Jesus frees it, promising to lead his people to new land; a new Eden where the original plan can flourish.

## 4. Theology is...

So as we come in to land, I want to summarise what we've thought about so far when it comes to the question 'What is Theology?'. I want to touch on three things: two that we have already looked at, and one final thing.

Firstly: Theology is about a 'why answer' to the question of what life is about. It's aim isn't to focus on the *how* behind the origin of the world or life. Don't get me wrong - the 'how answers' matter. We need them. But Theology is about something different; it isn't about fighting the Biologists and Cosmologists or challenging the sciences. Theology's aim, instead, is to offer up what the other 'ologies' cannot - a way of engaging with the *why* behind the world: the guy and his story.

That brings us to our second point: Theology is about studying and reflecting on the 'why answer'; it's about the story of the guy who kicked the ball. So, theology is about reflecting on the story - the story of the Exodus God.

Because the world is God's world, and because its story is God's story, every question leads back to it; every question leads back to the story.

1. If we want to know who God is, we must study the story.
2. If we want to know who we are, we must study the story.
3. If we have questions about the Gospel, the Church, things-to-come, or how we interact with our world, we must study the story.

Over the coming months, we will be exploring these topics. We'll be asking who God is, what it means to be human, what makes the Church the Church; we will consider the Gospel, wrestle with who Jesus really is, and think about what lies in store for the world, and how to engage with it. Now, all of these areas have their own special branches of Theology. But for us, all of this theological exploration will be done through study of the story - for the simple reason that everything in the heavens and everything on the earth is a part of God's story. Including ... you, which leads us to our final point:

Theology is an invitation.

We live in a culture where - for many - a 'how answer' is enough. If the universe has no force behind it - no guy to kick the ball - then you are free to create your own 'why'; to live life on your terms; to prioritise your own desires; to worship what you see fit. Many of the world's 'ologies' - whether it be Biology or Cosmology - take no issue with this.

Theology, however, points into the distance and says, 'You are not in your own story. You are in that guy's story; the guy who kicked the ball'. We are living in God's 'why'. And so, theology is an invitation to live life on God's good terms - to let Him shape our desires. Theology is an invitation to worship.

This is God's world, and that means that you are in an Exodus story. The question just under the surface is this: Are you going to join in; to allow God to free you from slavery; to pass through the waters of baptism; to receive God's guiding Spirit; to follow Him on the way to new life; and to point the world in the same direction? And so, for me, the ultimate theological question isn't about the origins of life, or the nature of morality - though those questions are important. For me, the ultimate theological question is, and always has been: Are you willing to journey with God and His Church in the wilderness, to worship Him with joy and thanksgiving, and to carry the story forward on the road to the promised land?
